A Web Auctioning platform to Digitalize the system of Auctioning which will save you from all the Crowd Hustle and will help you participate in distant Auctions from the comfort and warmth of your homes.

Auctopus is made in Django and houses the power to handle multiple Auction events simultaneously just like the multiple tentacles of an Octopus and hence its name.

## Applications of Auctopus

* Gives the user a platform to sell their belongings at the best price that the customers are willing to pay.
* Buyers do not have to move to some crowdy location to auction and they will miss no opportunity to bid for their favourite items.
* The Auction of a commodity closes automatically after 24 hours from the time started. It helps the seller to quickly sell his items and finish his deal.
* Live Cryptocurrency rates can also be viewed and bidders also have the option to bid in terms of Cryptocoins.

Here the actors are the client and the admin. They interact with each other through the interface of the web app. Any unregistered user can register himself into the app using the register functionality. Any register has to first login into the Auction portal in order to bid or add items for auctioning. The admin has the right to accept or reject the auction request. The several use cases shown above are: 
* Login/Register: This allows unregistered users to register into the auction portal and the registered users to login into the app. 

* Bidding Space: This contains the list of all the items which are currently being auctioned. The user can increase the current bid in order to participate. When the bidding timer runs out, the user with the highest bid is declared to have bought the item. 

* Add item request: This allows any user to pitch a request for auctioning any item. 

* Accept/Reject request: Admin can either accept or reject any auction request pitched up by a client. 

* Cryptocurrency Exchange: This informs the users the current exchange rates of various cryptocurrencies. 

* Account Balance: This allows the users to maintain a balance amount in the portal and use it for buying the items. 

* View Profile: This shows the profile of the user which contains various info such as the balance and the list of items purchased by the user.
